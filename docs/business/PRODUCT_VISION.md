## Mission

**Make data transformation accessible to everyone through natural language.**

---

## The Problem

Data cleaning is the most time-consuming part of any data project:
- Data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data
- Non-technical users can't transform data without code
- Existing tools require learning complex interfaces or programming

---

## Our Solution

ModularData lets users transform data by describing what they want in plain English:

> "Remove rows where email is blank"
> "Convert dates to YYYY-MM-DD format"
> "Fill missing ages with the average"

The AI understands intent and executes the correct transformations.
