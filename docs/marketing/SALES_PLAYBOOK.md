- Need for self-service data prep

### Warning Signs

- Already have robust data platform
- Need real-time streaming (not our strength)

"Transform data 10x faster without writing code"

### For Business Users
"Clean your own data without waiting for IT"

### For Engineering Leaders
"Reduce data engineering backlog"
