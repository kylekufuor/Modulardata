## Boilerplate

### Short (50 words)
ModularData is an AI-powered data transformation API. Users describe transformations in plain English, and the AI executes them automatically. No coding required.

### Medium (100 words)
ModularData is an AI-powered data transformation platform that lets users clean and transform data using natural language. Instead of writing pandas code or learning complex tools, users simply describe what they want: "remove rows where email is blank" or "convert dates to YYYY-MM-DD format." The AI understands intent and applies the correct transformations. With 53 built-in transformations, full version history, and an API-first design, ModularData makes data preparation accessible to everyone.
